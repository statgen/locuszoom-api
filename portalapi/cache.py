  def store(self,key,start,end,data):
    """
    Store data into a cache.

    It is normally expected that your key contains something chromosome or region specific,
    though it is not required.

    If you attempt to store data that is within the bounds of what has already been stored, this method is
    essentially a noop.

    If you store data for an interval that is larger than what was previously stored, only the disjoint (new)
    start/end intervals/data will be inserted. Previous data in the cache will be left untouched.

    To completely store new data within an interval, you should delete the key first.

    Args:
      key: str
      start: int
      end: int
      data: dict, mapping a position (int) to a value. e.g.:
        data[19141413] = {
          "variant": "1:1_A/G",
          "r2": 0.34

  def retrieve(self,key,start,end,force_subinterval=False):
    """
    Returns an interval from the cache.

    If you request a region that is larger than what has been previously stored before, the method will normally return
    None to signify that you need to compute for the larger region. This behavior can be overriden by supplying
    force_subinterval=True, which causes this method to return any data within the interval specified regardless.

    It you request a region that is smaller than the previously stored bounds, it will be returned.

    Args:
      key: str
